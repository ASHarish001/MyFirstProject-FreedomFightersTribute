        <p>
            Jawahar Lal Nehru was an Indian independence fighter and the first prime minister of India. He was considered as a central warrior in Indian Politics before independence as well as after independence. He was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad and served the nation from 1947 until his death in 1964. The birthplace of Jawahar Lal Nehru is Prayagraj which is in Allahabad. Due to his association with the Kashmiri Pandit community, he was also known as Pandit Nehru, while the Indian kids referred to them as Chacha Nehru. Jawahar Lal Nehru’s birthday is widely celebrated as Children’s day. His father’s name is Motilal Nehru who served as Indian Prime minister in 1919 and 1928.

        <h2>ChildHood and Early Age</h2>
        <p>
            He grew up in a privileged atmosphere in a rich home. His father trained him by private governesses and tutors. Nehru became interested in science and theosophy under the influence of Ferdinand T. Brooks' tutelage. At the age of thirteen, family friend Annie Besant subsequently introduced him to the Theosophical Society. For nearly three years Brooks was with me and in some ways, he influenced me greatly.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            In October 1907, Nehru visited Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated with an honours degree in science in 1910. He also studied politics, economics, history, and literature with little interest during this time. Most of his political and financial philosophy was molded by the writings of Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, John Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Lowes Dickinson, and Meredith Townsend.

            After completing his degree in 1910, Nehru moved to London and studied law at the Inner Temple Inn. During this period, including Beatrice Webb, he continued researching the Fabian Society scholars. He was called to the Bar in 1912.

        <h2>Early Struggle for Independence</h2>
        <p>
            During his time in Britain as a student and a barrister, Nehru developed an interest in Indian politics. Nehru attended an annual session of the Indian National Congress in Patna within months of his return to India in 1912. In 1912, Congress was the party of progressives and elites, and he was disconcerted by what he saw as "very much an English-knowing upper-class affair." Nehru had reservations about Congress' efficacy but decided to work for the party to support the Indian civil rights movement led in South Africa by Mahatma Gandhi, raising funds for the movement in 1913. Later, in the British colonies, he protested against indentured labour and other such injustice faced by Indians.

        <p>
            After 1962, Nehru's health started to decline slowly, and he spent months recovering in Kashmir until 1963. He felt very relaxed after his return from Dehradun on 26 May 1964 and went to bed, as usual, he had a restful night after he returned from the bathroom, Nehru complained of back pain. He talked to the doctors who were attending him for a short time, and Nehru collapsed almost instantly. Before he died, he remained unconscious. His death was registered to Lok Sabha on 27 May 1964 (the same day) the cause of death is suspected to be a heart attack. The body of Jawaharlal Nehru was put for public viewing on the Indian national Tri-colour flag. Nehru was cremated on 28 May at Shantivan on the banks of the Yamuna by Hindu rituals, witnessed by 1.5 million mourners flocking to the streets of Delhi and the cremation grounds.
